# Online Portfolio
Online Portfolio for Application to GC

I put together a collection of links to selected works that I have done over the past few years as a sort of online portfolio to draw attention to the projects I am most proud of.  You can see all my work in [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/betsyrosalen) and Github in both my [personal](https://github.com/betsyrosalen) and [work](https://github.com/betsyCC) profiles but this is a way to sort through to some of (what I hope are) the more interesting items.
