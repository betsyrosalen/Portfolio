## Tableau Dashboards

- [CUNY Student Data Book](https://insights.cuny.edu/#/site/CUNYGuest/views/StudentDataBook/Enrollment) -
This project was created for CUNY to replace the static pdf reports they used to publish on the OAREDA website (when it was still OIRA). It was meant to replace existing tables of data so there arenâ€™t many graphs or charts in it, but you can change the tables using the parameters on the right side to get almost any breakdown or sub-population that you are interested in. There are 14 tabs at the top for 3 main groups of data: enrollment, degrees granted, and retention and graduation.

- [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elizabeth.rosalen) - All three projects completed for DATA 73000 Visualization and Design at CUNY Graduate Center can be found on my Tableau Public profile. They are best viewed on a computer in full screen. I may add mobile versions in the future, but they are not done as of now. More information about the design process for the final project, Exoplanets, can be found in the [Exoplanets Whitepaper](https://github.com/betsyrosalen/Portfolio/blob/main/Final_Project_White_Paper.pdf).


## Shiny Apps

- [Draft Student Data Book for CUNY](https://cuny-oira.shinyapps.io/CUNY_Data_Book_Shiny_DRAFT/) - This is a prototype draft for the CUNY Student Data Book in R Shiny that we had to abandon due to legal issues with the RServer end user agreement. It might take a minute to load but should work pretty smoothly once it is loaded. Not all pages have data since it was just a prototype. Two particularly interesting pages are the FTE Enrollment Trends, which includes sparklines and the corresponding FTE Enrollment Trends plot, which you can access via the tab at the top of the page.

- [CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System Explorer](https://betsyrosalen.shinyapps.io/DATA608_Final_Project_Youth_Risk_Behavior/) - Final project for DATA 608 Knowledge and Visual Analytics at CUNY School of Professional Studies

## D3.js

- [CUNY Student Population Map](https://betsyrosalen.github.io/DATA_73200_Final_Project/charts/pointMap/) - Final project for DATA 73200 Interactive Data Visualization at CUNY Graduate Center. Additional Information about the project can be found here: [rpubs.com/betsyrosalen/CUNYmapREADME](https://rpubs.com/betsyrosalen/CUNYmapREADME)
